While compiling your own version of FiSSH.exe may seem like a bright idea,
here are a few reasons why you should consider just using the release provided:

a) You can just use install script without modification :-)
b) FiSSH.exe is signed with fully trusted Digital Signature and Timestamped
c) Help is provided (when I have free time, I make NO guarantee and provide NO warranty, read MIT LICENSE)

NOTE:
* IF YOUR COPY OF FiSSH.EXE IS NOT THE OFFICIAL ONE, YOU FORFEIT ALL HELP FROM ME! (SORRY) *
